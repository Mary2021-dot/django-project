    <h2>Success Stories</h2>
    <p>At our orphanage, we are proud to have helped many children overcome difficult circumstances and achieve their dreams. Here are just a few of their stories:</p>
    <div class="story">
      <h3>John's Story</h3>
      <img src="{% static 'images/john.jpeg' %}" alt="John">
      <p>John was abandoned by his parents at a young age and left to fend for himself on the streets. He was malnourished and had never attended school. When he came to our orphanage, we provided him with food, shelter, and education. With hard work and dedication, John excelled in school and went on to attend college. He now works as a successful engineer and is grateful for the opportunities that our orphanage provided him.</p>

    <div class="story">
      <h3>Sarah's Story</h3>
      <img src="{% static 'images/sarah.jpeg' %}" alt="Sarah">
      <p>Sarah's parents were killed in a car accident when she was just six years old. She was taken in by her grandparents, but they struggled to provide for her. When Sarah came to our orphanage, she was shy and withdrawn. With the help of our counselors, she was able to work through her grief and become a confident and outgoing young woman. Sarah is now pursuing a degree in social work and hopes to help other children who have experienced loss and trauma.</p>
